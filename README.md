# The-Longest-Common-Subsequence-using-Java

<p>
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without 
changing the order of the remaining elements. The Longest common subsequence (LCS) of two sequences 
is a subsequence, with maximal length, which is common to both the sequences. </br>
Given two strings, A = a1a2...an and B = b1b2...bm, find the longest common subsequence and print it. If there 
are multiple common subsequences with the same maximum length, print all of them.
</p></br>
<h5>Input Format</h5>
Two strings A and B given in two lines.</br>

<h5>Constraints</h5>
The characters of strings are English lowercase alphabetic letters.</br>
0 <= length(A), length(B) <= 100
